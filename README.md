### IndyWiki: Web3Native Tinkerable Wiky. You do not go to _some place_ to collaborate using a Wiki. 

> Bootstrap self-organizing writing communities with IndyWiki, the simplest possible constellation of "web native" P2P capabilities to facilitate _deep conversation_, _mutual learning_, and _co-authorship_. Every author has their own _personal_ wiki, which is _shareable_ either publically or privately and _collaborative_ within trusted peer networks, who write and learn together on their own(ed) networks.



## An introduction: _IndyWiki in a Nutshell_
_IndyWiki_, or _Wiky_ for short, is the foundational component of an actively developing architecture: _IndyVerse_, which will be an hypermedia contextualization engine for symmathetic writing —we intend to facilitate the practice of [_learning together_](https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/) by _writing together_. IndyWiki is the foundation of this larger work, because the wiki is the simplest possible medium of nonlinear symmathetic writing. In the most simple terms, the scope of IndyWiki is to bring the wiki to Web3 with a keen eye on the horizon of interoperable P2P protocols and the development of interpersonal _tools for thought_.



## Inspiration: _Tools for Thought_
The IndyWiki project emerges from a long philosophical adventure of developing tools, or _mediums_, for thought that serve to “augment human awareness.” The dream that began as early as the 1960s to design for _interpersonal_ computing to “change the thought patterns of an entire civilization” continues today with renewed energy catalyzed by the recent advances in P2P technology, especially the development of IPFS, [The Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/).

See Michael Nielsen’s excellent work, [“How can we develop transformative tools for thought?”](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) and Gyuri Lajos’ [“Augmenting Tacit Awareness”](http://polanyisociety.org/2019pprs/Lajos&Goodman-Augmenting-Tacit-Awareness-6-16-19.pdf) for a deeper exploration of this philosophical background and the status of our ongoing cultural revolution. To be brief, this work is the result of lifetimes of devotion to _mnemonic mediums_ that support the cultural evolution of natural, human intelligence. We are inspired and guided by Michael Polanyi’s appreciation of our natural affiliation as communities of thought, by the tradition initiated by Teilhard de Chardin, and by the living tradition of _Peace through Culture_.



## Technical Overview: _Web3 Foundations_
IndyWiki carries the classic nonlinear, collaborative writing experience of _the wiki_ into the Web3 era. It is built with [AppRun](https://apprun.js.org/) and deployed with [Fission](https://whitepaper.fission.codes/), the distributed framework built on IPFS for [“web native” applications](https://fission.codes/blog/intro-web-native-apps/) that integrates [passwordless authentication](https://webauthn.io/), [content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/), [unified storage](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs), [distributed data](https://orbitdb.org/), [cryptographic authorization](https://fission.codes/blog/auth-without-backend/), [portable computation](https://guide.fission.codes/webassembly/storing-webassembly-modules#storing-webassembly-modules), and [digital security](https://whitepaper.fission.codes/authorization/id-overview).


## The Purpose: _Interpersonal Hypermedia_
The present state of distributed technologies provides an excellent foundation to accelerate the possibilities of interpersonal computing. IndyWiki provides the basic functionality that one expects from any wiki software: the ability to contextualize content by the collaborative writing of nonlinear hypermedia. Wielding the advantages of the P2P tech ecosystem, this project is designed to go further by facilitating the symmathetic exploration of nonlinear, emergent conversations in trusted peer networks. We seek to encourage the mutual learning experiences of creative teams and communities of thought by facilitating the practice of collaborative research, holosubjective sensemaking, and co-authorship.

IndyWiki utilizes the authentication and authorization protocols provided by Fission to secure the collaborative work of trusted peers. The latest serverless technology enables us to liberate the wiki, our hypermedia, and our co-creative writing.

## IndyWiki: _Welcome to the IndyVerse_
Inter Planetary, InterPersonal Web3Native Wiki powered by TrailMarks, MindDrive, IndieHub, Fission & OrbitDb.
Forge the IndyVerse by participating in Open, Commons Based Peer Production of Software as Conversation about shared Interests and Intents.
Bootstrap, co-meta-design, co-evolve Web 3 Native Tools for Organizing, Sharing Frontiers of Inter Planetary, Inter Personal Knowledge.
IndyWiki flips the paradigm of Web 2.0.

Web 2.0 allowed users to generate and share content by visiting social networks or social media sites.
Users flocked to sites to participate and make use of these centralized capabilities.

Web 3.0 flips that. It allows people to connect with each other directly and allow capabilites to come to them to
generate content for themselves and give them the capacity to share their own(ed) content in their own terms.
