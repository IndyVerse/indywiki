IndyWiki flips the paradigm of Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 allowed users to generate and share content by visiting social networks or social media sites.
Users flocked to sites to participate and make use of these centralized capabilities.
Web 3.0 flips that. It allows people to connect with each other directly and allow capabilites to come to them to
generate content for themselves and give them the capacity to share their own(ed) content in their own terms.
